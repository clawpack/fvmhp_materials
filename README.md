This repository collects some materials to accompany the book

Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems by Randall J. LeVeque, Cambridge University Press, 2002.

See the [book webpage](http://www.clawpack.org/fvmhp_materials/) for links to the book, errata, and [Clawpack](http://www.clawpack.org) code to accompany the book.

## Contents

This repository currently contains:

- Slides to accompany a set of lectures from 2023 that will be posted on YouTube soon.
- Latex files that created the slides, which you are free to modify or recombine for your own lectures.

In the future other materials may be added, in particular some Jupyter notebooks to illustrate some of this material.
