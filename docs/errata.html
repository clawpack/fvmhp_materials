0.038</b>.

<p>
p. 333, Figure 15.6:  
The HLLE Riemann solver used to compute the results shown in Figure 15.6
had a bug.<br>   The correct results look only slightly better.
See <a href="../book/chap15/wcblast/www">book/chap15/wcblast</a> for the
corrected code and new figures.

should be "(h_r <b>v</b>_r - h_l <b>v</b>_l)"

<p>
p. 481, equation (21.36): 
If u_r does not equal u_l then the expression (21.36) can be simplified to
obtain (21.34) using the definition of u_hat.  Hence use of
the Roe average (21.34) does give a matrix $\hat A$ that satisfies the usual
requirement (21.35) and the discussion at the bottom of this page should be
deleted.
