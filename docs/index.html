This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential
equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating
their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation
laws.  These equations describe a wide range of wave-propagation and
transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering
discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner,
along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems.
High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann
problems are solved to determine the local wave structure
and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations.
These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately,
but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation
problems, particularly in heterogenous material.  The methods studied
are implemented in the 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/">Clawpack software</a>.
software package and source code for all
the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of
many time-dependent solutions.  This provides an excellent learning
environment
for understanding wave-propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.

<h3>Simulations and Clawpack Software: </h3>
<P>
Most of the figures in the book showing computational results
were created using 
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/clawpack-4.3" target="_top">
Clawpack Version 4.3</a>. 
Many of the examples have since been converted to the newer
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/">Clawpack Version 5.x</a> form, 
and can be viewed in the 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/gallery/gallery/gallery_fvmbook.html">Gallery
of fvmbook applications</a>, while the source code is located in the 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/apps.html">apps repository</a>, in the
<b>fvmbook</b> directory, which you can 
<a href="https://github.com/clawpack/apps/tree/master/fvmbook">view on GitHub</a>. 
For more information, see also the documentation page
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/book.html">Examples from the book
FVMHP</a>.

   <h3>New book: </h3>
The book <a href="http://www.clawpack.org/riemann_book/">Riemann Problems and 
Jupyter Solutions</a> by D.I. Ketcheson, R.J. LeVeque, and M.J. del Razo
(SIAM, 2020) illustrates many aspects of Riemann problems and their solution
in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

<h3>Videos and slides: </h3>
<P>
A series of 25 lectures recorded in 2023, originally as supplementary
material for the graduate level course 
<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am574w2023/">
Applied Math 574 at the University of Washington</a>, 
Videos are available on the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIdwWtDvUG_kdn-KiSVroQ">Clawpack
YouTube channel</a> in the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHJVj2zE9oLRPo7Xn1QI6WTl9QrBXLkqS">FVMHP playlist</a>.

<p>
Slides to accompany these lectures (both pdf and the latex source) are
available on GitHub in the
<a
href="https://github.com/clawpack/fvmhp_materials">clawpack/fvmhp_materials</a>
repository.

this page from AMath 574</a> for more detailed contents of each 
lecture and links to individual videos and slide decks.

<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/clawpack/fvmhp_materials/tree/main/slides/README.md">
