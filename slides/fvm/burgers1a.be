{\blue Conservation form:} $u_t + \left(\half u^2\right)_x = 0, 
\qquad f(u) = \half u^2$.

\vsp
{\blue Quasi-linear form:} $\qquad  u_t + uu_x = 0.$

Like an advection equation with $u$ advected with speed $u$.
\vsp
True solution: $u$ is constant along characteristic with speed
$f'(u)=u$ until the wave ``breaks'' {\red ~~(shock forms)}.
