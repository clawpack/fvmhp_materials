Viscous Burgers' equation:
\[
u_t + \left(\half u^2\right)_x = \eps u_{xx}, \qquad \eps > 0.
\]
\vsp

Has a smooth solution for all time.  
\vsp
As $\eps \goto 0$ steep gradients approach discontinuities.
\vsp
Often want to capture limiting shock wave behavior without solving viscous
equation.
\vsp
Need to define ``weak solution'' to PDE that allows shocks.
