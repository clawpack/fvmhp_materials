Instead of pressure, there is a symmetric {\blue stress tensor} 
\[
\sigma = \bcm \sige11&\sige12&\sige13\\
\sige12&\sige22&\sige23\\
\sige13&\sige23&\sige33\ecm.
\]
In a gas, 
\[
\sigma(x,y,z,t) = -p(x,y,z,t) \bcm 1&0&0\\0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\ecm
\] 
This reduces to one variable, the pressure.
\vsp
More generally compressional stress is not isotropic and there are also
{\blue shear stresses} that resist shear motions.
