# fvmhp_materials/slides_pdf

This directory contains a pdf file for each slide deck.

In addition, `fvmhp01-25.pdf` contains all slides from decks 01-25, and
`fvmhp01-25_draft.pdf` contains a version showing the path to the latex
source for each individual slide in the bottom corner of the slide.

Latex source for each slide deck can be found in the `slides` directory,
and for each slide in `slides/fvm`.
